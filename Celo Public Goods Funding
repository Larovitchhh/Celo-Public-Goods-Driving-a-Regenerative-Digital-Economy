In the first half of 2024, CeloPG executed a robust funding strategy under CGP115, allocating a budget of 1,600,000 cUSD and 700,000 CELO to support initiatives that generate long-term value for Celo. The funding was distributed across several strategic categories:Regional DAOs: 500,000 cUSD to support growth and development in key geographic regions.
Celo Project Incubation: 325,000 cUSD and 100,000 CELO for incubating new and existing projects on Celo.
Celo Grants and Requests for Proposals: 500,000 cUSD to fund Celo-native grants and targeted proposals.
Quadratic Funding (QF) and Retroactive Public Goods Funding (RPGF) Rounds: 125,000 cUSD and 500,000 CELO for community-driven funding rounds, including a pilot CeloRPGF0 round with 250,000 CELO.

The Celo Public Goods Hub (available at celopg.eco) serves as a central platform for applicants to submit proposals and for Celo voters to review and vote on initiatives. Proposals are evaluated through the Celo Public Goods Snapshot space, requiring a quorum of 2.5 million CELO and a majority of YES votes to pass.
