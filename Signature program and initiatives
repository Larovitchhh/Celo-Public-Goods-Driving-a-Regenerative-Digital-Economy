One of CeloPGâ€™s flagship initiatives is CeloRPGF0, the first Retroactive Public Goods Funding program on Celo, launched in collaboration with EasyRPGF. This program distributed over 250,000 CELO to reward projects and individuals who have significantly contributed to the Celo ecosystem since its mainnet launch in 2020. The program, which ran from April to May 2024, included key dates for registration, application submission, review, and voting, culminating in results announced at Celo Gather on May 24, 2024. Eligible projects spanned ReFi, dApps, tooling, and community adoption initiatives, with applications requiring a Hypercert to document their impact.
