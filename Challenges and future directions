Despite its successes, CeloPG has faced challenges, such as low voter participation in the CeloPG Snapshot due to technical limitations for Celo validators and stakeholders. To address this, CPG Stewards have worked with the Snapshot team to ensure broader voter access and have temporarily used existing Celo Governance contracts to tally votes.

Looking ahead, CeloPG aims to refine its strategies based on insights from H1 2024. The CeloPG H1 Report, released in June 2024, highlights progress and provides suggestions for future strategies. Upcoming initiatives include the GG21 Celo Gitcoin Launch, with 75,000 cUSD allocated for dApp and community-focused rounds, and continued scaling of programs like CeloRPGF based on pilot results.
