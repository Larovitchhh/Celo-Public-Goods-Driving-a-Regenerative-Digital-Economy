CeloPG actively collaborates with ecosystem partners to drive innovation. For instance, it supported the integration of ecocredits into Regen Atlas, enabling access to curated environmental assets like Terrasos Biodiversity Unit credits for ecosystem preservation. Additionally, CeloPG works with platforms like Gitcoin and the Climate Coordination Network (CCN) to fund climate solutions, such as the GG20 Climate Solutions Round, which allocated 50,000 cUSD for ReFi projects.

The initiative also fosters collaboration through programs like the Deploy on Celo Campaign, which attracts and reactivates projects to build on Celo, and the CeloPG Platform, a comprehensive portal for projects, programs, and resources.
