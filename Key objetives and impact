CeloPG operates with a clear focus on three key verticals to support the Celo ecosystem:Celo ReFi (Regenerative Finance): Supporting projects that enable real-world impact and ecological benefits, such as climate solutions and biodiversity preservation.
Celo dApp Ecosystem: Funding tools and decentralized applications (dApps) that create meaningful impact for Celo’s diverse user base.
Celo Community, Education, and Adoption: Backing non-software initiatives like community growth, onboarding, educational resources, and advocacy for inclusion and diversity.

The initiative has already achieved significant milestones, including distributing over $1 million in value to builders in collaboration with Gitcoin and hosting the first Celo Retro programs, such as Celo Citizen Retro and CeloRPGF0. These efforts demonstrate CeloPG’s commitment to rewarding past contributions while fostering future innovation.
